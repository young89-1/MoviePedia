# Scene It App

Guided tutorial to build an app that handles user search and displays all movies that contain the given sentence. 

## Objective

Now that we’ve got a good general understanding of  how we can render data to the DOM, we’re going to take a stab at building a practical application, worthy of a spot in our portfolios! The app is called Scene It, and it’s a simple tool for searching for movies, flagging ones you want to watch, and later giving them a thumbs up or thumbs down after you watch them. The finished product will use Axios to make requests to an external API called OMDB.
